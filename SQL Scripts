-- Step 3 DATABASE SCHEMA DESIGN

--Customers

CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    region VARCHAR(50)
);

--Products

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

--Sales

CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    sale_date DATE,
    quantity INT,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);

--STEP 4 SQL JOINS

--INNER JOIN

SELECT c.customer_name, p.product_name, s.total_amount
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id;

--LEFT JOIN

SELECT c.customer_name
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
WHERE s.sale_id IS NULL;

-- RIGHT JOIN

SELECT p.product_name
FROM sales s
RIGHT JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE s.sale_id IS NULL;

--FULL OUTER JOIN

SELECT c.customer_name, s.sale_id
FROM customers c
FULL OUTER JOIN sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id;

--SELF JOIN

SELECT a.customer_name AS customer1, b.customer_name AS customer2, a.region
FROM customers a
JOIN customers b
ON a.region = b.region
AND a.customer_id <> b.customer_id;

--Step 5: Window Functions Implementation

--Ranking Functions

SELECT customer_id,
       SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(total_amount) DESC) AS revenue_rank
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;

--Aggregate Window Functions

SELECT sale_date,
       SUM(total_amount) AS daily_sales,
       SUM(SUM(total_amount)) OVER (
           ORDER BY sale_date
           ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) AS running_total
FROM sales
GROUP BY sale_date;

--Navigation Functions

SELECT sale_date,
       SUM(total_amount) AS monthly_sales,
       LAG(SUM(total_amount)) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS previous_month_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY sale_date;

--Distribution Functions

SELECT customer_id,
       SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(total_amount) DESC) AS spending_quartile
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
